6) Keywords Research

• The selected keywords, "affordable gaming laptops" and "best smart home devices 2024,"
were chosen based on their substantial search volume, moderate to low competition, and
high relevance to an online electronics retailer. These keywords are likely to drive targeted
traffic, improving SEO and attracting potential customers interested in budget gaming
laptops and the latest smart home technologies.

engaging content, a clear call-to-action, and personalized messaging. Highlighting discounts
on popular brands like Apple and Sony, the email aims to increase sales and customer
engagement. This approach demonstrates effective use of email marketing to promote
products, attract customers, and boost overall sales performance.
